Ad Hawk
=======

[Ad Hawk](http://adhawk.sunlightfoundation.com/) is an Android app that listens to and identifies political ads as they air, and tells you who is behind them.

Download it on the [Google Play app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunlightfoundation.adhawk.android), or visit the [Ad Hawk website](http://adhawk.sunlightfoundation.com/) for more information on the app, and on the super PAC ads in our database.


Fingerprinting Ads
------------------

Ad Hawk uses the open-source [EchoPrint](http://echoprint.me/) library to compare the snippet of recorded audio to a database of audio fingerprints of political ads.
